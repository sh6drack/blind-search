class MazeGenerator(SearchProblem[MazeState]):
    """
    Generates a maze as a search problem 

    This class initializes a maze with walls surrounding every cell. The maze 
    generation process can be driven by applying search algorithms like BFS or DFS, 
    which explore the maze and create paths by visiting cells and removing walls. 
    It keeps track of the visited cells and checks when all cells have been 
    visited (i.e., when the maze is fully generated).

    Attributes:
        width (int): The width of the maze in terms of the number of cells.
        height (int): The height of the maze in terms of the number of cells.
        board (Tuple[Tuple[MazeRoom]]): A 2D list representing the maze grid where each cell is a MazeRoom.
        start_state (MazeState): The starting state of the maze, where the generation begins.
        visited_cells_count (int): The count of cells that have been visited during maze generation.
        total_cells (int): The total number of cells in the maze.

        Generates the successor states from the current state in the maze.

        This method explores the possible moves from the current state by checking 
        adjacent cells in the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west). 
        It only considers cells that have not been visited and are within the maze's 
        boundaries. When a valid move is found, the wall between the current cell 
        and the adjacent cell is removed, and the adjacent cell is marked as visited.
